# Password-Gen

## The Assignment
The task we were given was to make a password generator that would randomly select a password based on an array of numbers and letters both uppercase and lowercase as well as special characters.

## The Process
For the first step I had to make all of the variables that would be used in the actual Javascript. This included both the variables that would be selected as well as the ones that would house the selections. Next we had to to create the functions to that when we tried to prompt the user everything would work correctly. Next we had to add the for loop so that the choice would be completely random and choose the number of characters the user enetered. When the process is all said and done the user must choose a number between 8 and 128 in order to generate a password.
